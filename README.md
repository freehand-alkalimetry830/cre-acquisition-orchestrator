I've been working on something that I think the CRE industry needs, and I wanted to share where it's at.

A few months ago I wrote about [what happens when you point 489 AI agents at a 200-unit multifamily acquisition](https://avihacker.substack.com/p/489-agents-200-leases-4-hours-this). That article was the vision. This repo is the engineering behind it - the actual agent prompts, orchestration logic, domain knowledge files, data contracts, and simulation engine that make that vision work.

**It's not fully production-ready.** I'm being honest about that. But what IS here is the most in-depth open-source framework I've seen for CRE acquisition orchestration - because nobody else has built one. There are agent frameworks for coding, customer support, and data analysis, but nothing for commercial real estate. CRE acquisitions involve dozens of specialized analyses with complex interdependencies and data handoffs across due diligence, underwriting, financing, legal, and closing. I've tried to model that entire workflow as an AI-native, multi-agent system.

Everything in here - the agent prompts, the skills, the schemas, the pipeline architecture - is yours to use as a starting point. Fork it. Build on it. Adapt it to your own deals, your own workflows, your own investment thesis. All I ask is that you keep the attribution (it's [Apache 2.0 licensed](LICENSE) - just give credit where it started). If this framework helps even one team rethink how they approach acquisitions, it was worth open-sourcing.

Let's bring this industry into the future.

> **Note:** The simulation engine runs fully offline - **no API keys required** to run the demo and explore the architecture. You can see the full pipeline execute with realistic CRE financials right out of the box.

> **Disclaimer:** This project is a reference architecture and educational framework, not production software for making investment decisions. The financial calculations, legal checklists, and agent outputs are for demonstration and learning purposes only. Nothing in this repository constitutes financial, legal, or investment advice. Always consult qualified professionals before making real estate investment decisions. This software is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind - see [LICENSE](LICENSE) for full terms.

## What's New in v1.1.0

- **Dashboard New Deal Wizard** - Create, validate, save, and launch deals directly from the dashboard without manually editing `config/deal.json`
- **Saved Deal Library** - Reopen draft deals, launch ready-to-run deals, and keep sample deals separate from user-created deals
- **Explicit Deal Launch Paths** - Dashboard launches now target saved deal files instead of assuming a single shared config file
- **Playwright End-to-End Coverage** - Browser tests now cover draft save, deal relaunch, wizard-based launch, and sample-deal launch flows
- **Stronger Dashboard Build Gate** - Dashboard build now typechecks both client and server-side TypeScript before bundling

## By the Numbers

| | | | |
|---|---|---|---|
| **31** AI Agents | **8** Domain Knowledge Skills | **10** JSON Schema Contracts | **9**-Tab Real-Time Dashboard |
| **5** Deal Phases | **3** Investment Scenarios | **54,000+** Lines of Code | **202** Files |

---

## Architecture

The system uses a **three-level agent hierarchy** - a master orchestrator coordinates five phase orchestrators, which in turn manage 21 specialist agents across the deal pipeline, plus 4 document ingestion agents. Each agent is defined as a detailed markdown prompt file encoding deep CRE domain knowledge.

At runtime, specialist agents can spawn additional child agents - the Scenario Analyst runs up to **27 scenario sub-analyses**, Lender Outreach contacts up to **12 lenders in parallel**, and the Estoppel Tracker manages up to **200 unit-level estoppel certificates**.

## The Pipeline

The acquisition pipeline models the real-world CRE deal lifecycle with **intelligent phase dependencies** - not a naive sequential chain:

| Phase | Starts When | Key Agents | Output |
|-------|-------------|------------|--------|
| **Due Diligence** | Immediately | Rent Roll Analyst, OpEx Analyst, Physical Inspection, Market Study, Environmental Review, Legal & Title Review, Tenant Credit | Property risk profile, market positioning, physical condition assessment |
| **Underwriting** | DD 100% complete | Financial Model Builder, Scenario Analyst, IC Memo Writer | Pro forma financials, 27-scenario stress test, investment committee memo |
| **Financing** | UW 100% complete | Lender Outreach, Quote Comparator, Term Sheet Builder | Lender quotes, comparative analysis, recommended term sheet |
| **Legal** | DD 80% complete (early start) | PSA Reviewer, Title & Survey, Estoppel Tracker, Loan Doc Reviewer, Insurance Coordinator, Transfer Doc Preparer | Contract review, title clearance, closing document preparation |
| **Closing** | All prior phases complete | Closing Coordinator, Funds Flow Manager | Final closing checklist, funds flow schedule, transfer execution |

The Legal phase demonstrates a key architectural decision: it starts at DD 80% completion to model how real CRE deals work - legal review begins before all diligence is complete, but the Loan Doc Reviewer specifically waits for Financing output before reviewing loan documents.

---

## Complete Agent Catalog

Every agent follows a **19-section prompt anatomy standard** (Identity, Mission, Tools, Inputs, Strategy, Output Format, Quality Gates, Checkpoint Protocol, Resume Protocol, Error Handling, Confidence Scoring, Dealbreaker Detection, Data Gap Handling, Self-Review, Escalation Rules, Logging, Coordination, Constraints, and Examples). See [Agent Development Guide](docs/AGENT-DEVELOPMENT.md) for the full specification.

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18+
- npm

### Run the Simulation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/ahacker-1/cre-acquisition-orchestrator.git
cd cre-acquisition-orchestrator

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the demo simulation (no API keys needed)
npm run demo
```

This runs a complete acquisition pipeline for the sample Parkview Apartments deal (200 units, Austin TX, $32M) using the deterministic simulation engine. All 5 phases execute, all 21 specialist agents produce outputs, and a final report with go/no-go recommendation is generated.

### Start the Dashboard

```bash
# In a separate terminal
npm run dashboard

# Open http://localhost:5173
```

The dashboard connects via WebSocket and shows the pipeline executing in real-time across 9 monitoring views.

From the dashboard you can now:
- create a new deal in the wizard
- save drafts to the deal library
- relaunch saved deals without replacing the shared sample config
- launch shipped sample deals directly from the library

### Document Ingestion (requires Claude Code CLI)

```bash
# Drop deal documents into the incoming folder
cp your-rent-roll.xlsx documents/incoming/
cp your-t12.xlsx documents/incoming/
cp your-offering-memo.pdf documents/incoming/

# Run the document orchestrator
claude "Process the documents in documents/incoming/ and create deal.json"

# Review extraction results
cat documents/extraction-report.md
cat config/deal.json
```

### Manual Deal Setup

Edit `config/deal.json` with your deal parameters and run:

```bash
npm run simulate
```

### End-to-End Tests

Run the browser test suite for the dashboard workflow:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

## Configuration

### Deal Parameters (`config/deal.json`)

Configure property details, financial assumptions, and data source files for your target acquisition. The sample deal is a 200-unit Class B multifamily in Austin, TX at $32M ($160K/unit).

### Investment Thresholds (`config/thresholds.json`)

Set go/no-go criteria: minimum DSCR (default 1.25x), maximum LTV (75%), target cap rate spread, minimum cash-on-cash return, and dealbreaker conditions.

### Scenarios (`config/scenarios/`)

Three pre-built scenarios with different market assumptions:
- **Core-Plus** - Stable occupancy, moderate rent growth, conservative exit assumptions
- **Value-Add** - Below-market rents, renovation upside, higher risk tolerance
- **Distressed** - High vacancy, elevated cap rates, complex legal, aggressive pricing

---

## Who Is This For?

- **CRE firms** exploring how AI agents could transform their acquisition workflow
- **Proptech developers** building tools for commercial real estate
- **AI engineers** looking for a real-world, domain-specific agent orchestration reference architecture
- **Anyone curious** about what multi-agent AI systems look like when applied to a complex, regulated industry

This is not an abstract demo - it models the actual workflow that CRE acquisition teams follow, with the domain-specific calculations, legal checklists, and financial models that real deals require.

---

## Roadmap

Potential future directions:

- [ ] Real LLM API integration (replacing simulation engine with live Claude/GPT agents)
- [ ] Additional property types (office, industrial, retail)
- [ ] Historical deal comparison database
- [ ] Automated lender matching via API
- [ ] Portfolio-level orchestration (multi-deal pipelines)
- [ ] Webhook integrations for deal management systems
