## INTRO (2 minutes)

### Opening Statement

> "Today I'm going to show you an AI-powered system that transforms how we analyze commercial real estate acquisitions."

### The Problem

> "A typical multifamily acquisition analysis takes 2-3 weeks of manual work across multiple teams: due diligence, underwriting, financing, legal review. Each handoff introduces delays and potential for human error."

### The Solution

> "This system automates the entire process. What used to take weeks now takes 24-48 hours, with more consistent analysis and full audit trails."

### Show the Deal

**Action:** Open `config/deal.json` in your editor or show on screen

> "Here's today's deal: Parkview Apartments. 200-unit multifamily property in Austin, Texas. Asking price: $32 million. This is a value-add opportunity - the units haven't been renovated since 2010."

**Key Points to Highlight:**
- Property: 200 units, 8 buildings, Class B
- Price: $32M ($160K/unit)
- Strategy: Value-add with $10K/unit renovation budget
- Target: 15% IRR, 1.8x equity multiple

## LAUNCH (1 minute)

### Start the Pipeline

> "Let me show you how easy it is to kick off the analysis."

**Action:** If not already running, demonstrate the launch command:

```bash
# From the cre-acquisition directory
cd dashboard && npm run dev
```

> "The system reads the deal configuration and begins autonomous analysis. Let's switch to the dashboard to see it in action."

**Action:** Open http://localhost:5173 in browser

> "The system is now analyzing this deal autonomously. It will work through five phases: Due Diligence, Underwriting, Financing, Legal, and Closing preparation."

---

## DASHBOARD TOUR (3 minutes)

### Pipeline View

**Action:** Click on "Pipeline" tab (should be default)

> "The Pipeline view shows the five phases of analysis. Each phase contains specialist AI agents working in parallel where possible."

**Point out:**
- Phase progression (DD → UW → Financing → Legal → Closing)
- Status indicators (green = complete, blue = running, gray = pending)
- Progress percentages

### Agent Tree

**Action:** Click on "Agent Tree" tab

> "The Agent Tree shows the hierarchical structure of our AI workforce. The Master Orchestrator coordinates everything. Under it, each phase has its own orchestrator managing specialist agents."

**Expand Due Diligence phase and explain:**
- Rent Roll Analyst - validates income assumptions
- OpEx Analyst - scrutinizes expenses
- Market Analyst - researches comparable properties
- Physical Inspector - assesses property condition
- Environmental Specialist - reviews Phase 1 reports
- Title Specialist - examines title and survey
- Tax Analyst - analyzes property taxes

> "Each of these agents can spawn additional sub-agents. For example, the rent roll analyst might spawn agents to analyze each unit type separately."

### Live Logs

**Action:** Click on "Logs" tab

> "Every action is logged in real-time. This creates a complete audit trail - you can see exactly what the system analyzed and when."

**Point out a few interesting log entries:**
- Agent launches
- Findings
- Checkpoint saves

### Findings Panel

**Action:** Click on "Findings" tab

> "As agents complete their work, they report findings here. Findings are categorized by severity: red flags, warnings, and positive indicators."

**If findings are available, highlight:**
- Any red flags detected
- Key metrics discovered
- Data gaps identified

---

## RESULTS (5 minutes)

### Due Diligence Findings

> "Let's look at what the Due Diligence phase found."

**Key Metrics to Discuss:**
- Unit mix validation: "The system verified 200 units across 4 floor plan types"
- Occupancy: "Current occupancy is 93%, with market at 95%"
- Loss-to-lease: "In-place rents are 8-10% below market, confirming value-add potential"
- Physical condition: "Building systems are functional but dated"

### Underwriting Output

> "The Underwriting phase builds a complete financial model."

**Key Metrics:**
- Year 1 NOI: ~$1.92M (current) → $2.24M (stabilized)
- Going-in Cap Rate: 6.0%
- Exit Cap Rate: 5.75% (5-year assumption)
- DSCR: 1.35x (exceeds 1.25x minimum)
- Projected IRR: 15.2% (meets 15% target)
- Equity Multiple: 1.85x (meets 1.8x target)

> "The system also runs 27 sensitivity scenarios: stress tests for rent growth, expense inflation, cap rate changes, and interest rate movements."

### Final Verdict

> "After all phases complete, the system produces a go/no-go recommendation."

**Show or describe expected outcome:**

> "For Parkview Apartments, we expect a CONDITIONAL PASS. The deal meets financial thresholds, but there are conditions: confirming renovation costs, addressing deferred maintenance items, and completing estoppel collection."

**Highlight the Value:**
- Consistent application of investment criteria
- No deals slip through the cracks
- Full documentation for IC presentation

## VALUE PROPOSITION (2 minutes)

### Time Savings

> "Let's talk about the impact on your business."

| Manual Process | AI-Powered |
|----------------|------------|
| 2-3 weeks | 24-48 hours |
| 5+ analysts | 1 deal manager |
| Multiple handoffs | Single automated workflow |
| Variable quality | Consistent analysis |

### Never Misses a Step

> "The system follows the same comprehensive checklist every time. It won't forget to check the Phase 1 environmental report. It won't skip the rent roll validation. Every deal gets the same rigorous analysis."

### Full Audit Trail

> "Every decision, every calculation, every finding is logged and traceable. When you present to your investment committee, you have complete documentation of how you arrived at your recommendation."

### Scalable Deal Flow

> "This means you can evaluate more deals without growing headcount. Your team focuses on relationship building and negotiation while the AI handles the analytical heavy lifting."

---

## Q&A (2 minutes)

### Anticipated Questions

**Q: "How accurate is it?"**
> "The system applies the same analytical frameworks your team uses. It's not making judgment calls on its own - it's applying your investment criteria consistently. The accuracy matches or exceeds manual analysis because it doesn't get tired or skip steps."

**Q: "What about unique situations?"**
> "The system flags unusual items for human review rather than making assumptions. If something doesn't fit the typical pattern, it escalates. Your team still makes the final call."

**Q: "How does it integrate with our existing process?"**
> "It produces standard output formats: IC memos, underwriting summaries, due diligence checklists. These slot directly into your existing investment committee process."

**Q: "What about data security?"**
> "The system runs locally in your environment. Deal data never leaves your network. All analysis happens on-premise with your existing security controls."

**Q: "Can we customize the criteria?"**
> "Absolutely. Investment thresholds, risk tolerances, deal structures - all configurable through threshold files. Different strategies can have different parameters."

---

## Closing

> "What you've seen today is a transformation of the acquisition analysis process. Faster, more consistent, fully documented. This is how modern CRE firms are gaining competitive advantage in deal sourcing and execution."

> "I'm happy to dive deeper into any aspect of the system, or we can discuss how this would integrate with your specific workflow."

## Demo Recovery Notes

If something goes wrong during the demo:

1. **Dashboard won't load**: "Let me show you the output files directly" → Open `data/reports/` folder
2. **Pipeline stalls**: "This is actually a great feature - the system checkpoints progress so we can resume exactly where we left off"
3. **Unexpected error**: "The error handling system captures full details for debugging. Let me show you how we'd diagnose this in production"

Remember: Confidence sells. Every technical hiccup is an opportunity to demonstrate the system's resilience.
