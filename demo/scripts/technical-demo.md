## SECTION 1: Architecture Overview (8 minutes)

### 1.1 System Introduction

> "Let me walk you through the technical architecture of the CRE Acquisition Orchestrator."

**Show:** Open the project in VS Code or your editor

> "The system is built on a hierarchical agent architecture. Think of it as a team of specialists, each with a specific role, coordinated by orchestrators at different levels."

### 1.2 Directory Structure

**Action:** Show the file tree

```

```

### 1.3 Agent Hierarchy

> "The hierarchy has four levels:"

**Draw or show diagram:**

```
Level 1: Master Orchestrator
         └── Coordinates entire pipeline
         └── Tracks overall progress
         └── Produces final verdict

Level 2: Phase Orchestrators (5)
         └── Due Diligence Orchestrator
         └── Underwriting Orchestrator
         └── Financing Orchestrator
         └── Legal Orchestrator
         └── Closing Orchestrator

Level 3: Specialist Agents (21 total)
         └── Rent Roll Analyst
         └── OpEx Analyst
         └── Market Analyst
         └── ... (domain experts)

Level 4: Child Agents (dynamic)
         └── Spawned as needed for parallelism
         └── Example: One agent per unit type
         └── Example: One agent per lender
```

### 1.4 Communication Flow

> "Agents communicate through checkpoints and logs. There's no direct agent-to-agent communication - everything goes through the orchestrator layer."

**Key points:**
- Each agent reads its instructions from a markdown prompt file
- Each agent writes its findings to a JSON checkpoint
- Orchestrators poll checkpoints to track progress
- Downstream phases read upstream checkpoints for input data

---

## SECTION 2: Agent Anatomy (6 minutes)

### 2.1 Agent Prompt Structure

**Action:** Open `agents/due-diligence/rent-roll-analyst.md`

> "Every agent is defined by a markdown prompt file. Let me show you the structure."

**Highlight these sections:**
1. **Identity Block** - Name, role, phase, reports-to relationship
2. **Mission** - What the agent is responsible for
3. **Tools Available** - What actions it can take
4. **Input Expectations** - What data it receives
5. **Task Execution** - Step-by-step instructions
6. **Output Format** - Required structure of findings
7. **Error Handling** - What to do when things go wrong

> "Notice this is plain markdown. No special syntax, no compilation. The AI model reads this directly as instructions."

### 2.2 Checkpoint Structure

**Action:** Open `templates/agent-checkpoint.json`

> "Every agent maintains a checkpoint that tracks its state."

```json
{
  "agentName": "rent-roll-analyst",
  "dealId": "DEAL-2026-001",
  "phase": "due_diligence",
  "status": "complete",
  "progress": 1.0,
  "startedAt": "2026-01-15T10:00:00Z",
  "completedAt": "2026-01-15T10:45:00Z",
  "findings": [...],
  "dataForDownstream": {...},
  "metrics": {...},
  "errors": []
}
```

**Explain:**
- Status: pending → running → complete (or failed)
- Progress: 0.0 to 1.0, updated incrementally
- Findings: Structured observations with severity
- DataForDownstream: What the next phase needs

### 2.3 Finding Structure

> "Findings have a consistent structure across all agents."

```json
{
  "id": "finding-001",
  "severity": "warning",
  "category": "income",
  "title": "Loss-to-Lease Detected",
  "detail": "In-place rents are 8% below market across all unit types",
  "impact": "Potential $280,000 annual revenue increase opportunity",
  "recommendation": "Budget for rent increases during first 12 months",
  "source": "Rent roll vs. market comp analysis",
  "confidence": 0.9
}
```

## SECTION 3: Checkpoint/Resume System (5 minutes)

### 3.1 Three-Tier State Management

> "The system uses a three-tier checkpoint system for complete recoverability."

**Tier 1: data/status/<deal-id>.json**
```markdown
# Session State: Parkview Apartments (DEAL-2026-001)

## Status: IN PROGRESS
## Phase: Due Diligence (85% complete)
## Started: 2026-01-15 10:00 UTC
## Last Update: 2026-01-15 14:30 UTC

### Phase Progress
| Phase | Status | Progress |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Due Diligence | Running | 85% |
| Underwriting | Pending | 0% |
| ... | ... | ... |
```

> "This is human-readable. Open it anytime to see where things stand."

**Tier 2: Deal Checkpoint** (`data/status/{deal-id}.json`)
> "This is the machine-readable master state. Contains all phase data, metrics, and the overall progress calculation."

**Tier 3: Agent Checkpoints** (`data/status/{deal-id}/agents/*.json`)
> "Individual state for each specialist agent. This is how we resume mid-agent."

### 3.2 Resume Demonstration

> "Let me show you what happens when we resume."

**Action:** Stop the pipeline mid-execution (or simulate with a checkpoint file)

> "Watch what happens when we restart."

**Explain the flow:**
1. Master orchestrator reads existing checkpoint
2. Sees phases 1-2 complete, phase 3 in progress
3. Skips completed phases (uses cached data)
4. Resumes phase 3 from where it stopped
5. Log shows: `[ACTION] Skipping Due Diligence - already complete`

> "Nothing is ever lost. Every step is checkpointed."

---

## SECTION 4: Customization Options (6 minutes)

### 4.1 Investment Thresholds

**Action:** Open `config/thresholds.json`

> "Investment criteria are fully configurable. Let me show you the threshold system."

```json
{
  "dscrMinimum": 1.25,
  "capRateSpreadMinimum": 100,
  "ltMaximum": 0.75,
  "debtYieldMinimum": 0.09,
  "strategyThresholds": {
    "core": {
      "minDSCR": 1.40,
      "minRiskScore": 85,
      "maxHighRisks": 0
    },
    "value-add": {
      "minDSCR": 1.20,
      "minRiskScore": 60,
      "maxHighRisks": 2
    }
  }
}
```

> "Different strategies have different risk tolerances. A core deal needs higher DSCR than a value-add deal."

### 4.2 Dealbreakers

> "You can define automatic fail conditions."

```json
{
  "dealbreakers": [
    "environmental_phase2_required",
    "title_uninsurable",
    "occupancy_below_60_percent",
    "negative_cash_flow_year1"
  ]
}
```

> "If any agent flags one of these, the verdict is automatically FAIL regardless of other metrics."

### 4.3 Adding a New Agent

> "Want to add a specialist for your firm's unique requirements? Here's how."

**Steps:**
1. Create the prompt file: `agents/due-diligence/my-specialist.md`
2. Register it: Add entry to `config/agent-registry.json`
3. Reference it: Update the phase orchestrator to spawn this agent
4. Define outputs: Specify what data it produces

> "The system is designed to extend. Add agents without changing core infrastructure."

---

## SECTION 5: Dashboard Deep Dive (3 minutes)

### 5.1 Real-Time Updates

**Action:** Show the dashboard with the pipeline running

> "The dashboard updates in real-time via WebSocket connection."

**Point out:**

- Progress percentages updating
- Log entries streaming
- Findings appearing as they're reported

### 5.2 Agent Tree Navigation

**Action:** Click through the Agent Tree tab

> "Click any agent to see its current state, findings, and metrics."

**Show:**
- Expanding phase hierarchies
- Agent status colors (green = complete, blue = running, gray = pending)
- Child agents under specialists

### 5.3 Final Report Generation

**Action:** Show or describe the Final Report tab

> "When complete, the system generates a comprehensive report with go/no-go verdict."

---

## Q&A Topics

### Common Technical Questions

**Q: "How does it handle API rate limits?"**
> "Each agent that makes external calls implements exponential backoff. If rate limited, it checkpoints, waits, and resumes. The logs show rate limit events clearly."

**Q: "Can we run this on-prem?"**
> "Absolutely. The entire system runs locally. You need Node.js for the dashboard and Claude Code for the AI runtime. No cloud dependencies for your deal data."

**Q: "What about sensitive data in prompts?"**
> "Deal data is injected at runtime - it's not stored in the prompts. The prompt files are generic instructions. Data stays in your `data/` directory and never leaves your environment."

**Q: "How do we monitor in production?"**
> "The dashboard provides real-time monitoring. For production, you'd add logging to your observability stack (Datadog, Splunk, etc.) by tailing the log files."

**Q: "What's the compute cost?"**
> "Primary cost is AI API calls. The system is optimized to minimize redundant calls through caching and checkpointing. A typical deal runs 1000-2000 API calls total."
