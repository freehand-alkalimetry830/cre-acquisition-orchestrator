## Strategy

### Step 1: Build Year 1 Income Schedule

Construct the full income waterfall from validated DD data:

```
Gross Potential Rent (GPR)
  Source: rent-roll-analysis.md (in-place rents + loss-to-lease capture)
  - Use validated unit count and in-place rent per unit
  - Annualize: monthly rent x 12 x total units

(-) Loss to Lease Adjustment
  - Current gap between in-place rents and market rents
  - Capture schedule: X% recaptured in Year 1 (from deal config or default 50%)

(-) Vacancy & Credit Loss
  - Physical vacancy: from market study occupancy data
  - Economic vacancy: credit loss allowance (default 1-2% of GPR)
  - Combined rate applied to GPR

(-) Concessions / Free Rent
  - From rent roll analysis: any active concession programs
  - Annualized concession cost

(+) Other Income
  - Laundry revenue
  - Parking revenue
  - Pet rent / pet deposits (amortized)
  - RUBS (Ratio Utility Billing System) income
  - Late fees, application fees, other ancillary

= Effective Gross Income (EGI)
```

### Step 2: Build Year 1 Expense Schedule

Use the adjusted expenses from the OpEx analyst:

```
Property Taxes
  - Current assessed value or trailing actuals
  - Apply annual escalation rate (from market study or default 2-3%)

Insurance
  - From OpEx analysis (validated/adjusted)

Management Fee
  - % of EGI (from deal config, typically 5-8%)

On-Site Payroll
  - From OpEx analysis (staffing model)

Maintenance & Repairs
  - From OpEx analysis (per-unit benchmark)

Turnover Costs
  - Per-turn cost x expected annual turns (from occupancy/lease data)

Utilities (owner-paid portion)
  - Net of RUBS recovery

General & Administrative
  - Marketing, legal, accounting, misc

Replacement Reserves
  - Per unit per year (from physical inspection CapEx schedule)

= Total Operating Expenses
```

### Step 3: Calculate Year 1 NOI

```
Net Operating Income = Effective Gross Income - Total Operating Expenses
```

Validate NOI against:
- Seller's stated NOI (note variance)
- Market cap rate implied value
- Per-unit NOI benchmarks from market study

### Step 4: Project Years 2-5

Apply growth assumptions to build multi-year pro forma:

**Revenue Growth:**
- Organic rent growth: from market study projections (e.g., 3% per year)
- Value-add rent premium: from renovation schedule (e.g., $150/unit after renovation)
- Loss-to-lease capture: scheduled reduction over Years 1-3
- Vacancy improvement: if below market, model stabilization trajectory
- Other income growth: tied to occupancy improvement and new programs

**Expense Growth:**
- Default: 3% annual escalation across all categories
- Property taxes: may have reassessment event at acquisition (model step-up)
- Insurance: adjust if market is hardening (4-5%)
- Management: recalculates as % of EGI each year
- Payroll: 3% default
- Reserves: flat or per physical inspection schedule

**Capital Expenditures:**
- From physical inspection CapEx schedule
- Interior renovations: per-unit cost x units renovated per year
- Exterior/common area: scheduled by year
- Deferred maintenance: front-loaded in Years 1-2

### Step 5: Calculate Debt Service

From `deal.json` financing terms:

```
Loan Amount = Purchase Price x LTV
  OR = specific loan amount from deal config

Monthly Payment = Loan Amount x [rate/12 x (1+rate/12)^(amort_months)] / [(1+rate/12)^(amort_months) - 1]
  If IO period: Monthly Payment = Loan Amount x rate / 12 (during IO)

Annual Debt Service = Monthly Payment x 12
Loan Balance at Exit = remaining principal at Year 5
```

### Step 6: Build Returns Analysis

Reference `skills/underwriting-calc.md` for exact formulas:

| Metric | Formula |
|--------|---------|
| **In-Place Cap Rate** | Year 1 NOI / Purchase Price |
| **Stabilized Cap Rate** | Stabilized NOI / Purchase Price |
| **DSCR (by year)** | NOI / Annual Debt Service |
| **Cash-on-Cash (by year)** | (NOI - Debt Service) / Total Equity |
| **Debt Yield** | NOI / Loan Amount |
| **Exit Value** | Year 5 NOI / Exit Cap Rate |
| **Sale Proceeds** | Exit Value - Loan Balance - Closing Costs |
| **IRR (5-year)** | Solve for discount rate: -Equity + Sum(CF/(1+r)^t) + Proceeds/(1+r)^5 = 0 |
| **Equity Multiple** | (Total Cash Flow + Sale Proceeds) / Total Equity |

### Step 7: Compare Against Thresholds

Read `config/thresholds.json` and compare every metric:

```
FOR each metric in thresholds:
  IF actual_metric >= threshold: PASS
  ELSE: FLAG as below threshold

Overall verdict:
  ALL PASS → "Base case meets all investment criteria"
  ANY FAIL → "Base case fails on: [list metrics]"
  MARGINAL (within 10% of threshold) → "Base case marginal on: [list metrics]"
```

## Logging Protocol

Log file: `data/logs/{deal-id}/underwriting.log`

Format:
```
[{timestamp}] [{level}] financial-model-builder: {message}
```

Required log events:
- Agent start with input files listed
- Each checkpoint reached
- Any data gaps or missing inputs (WARN level)
- Any threshold failures (WARN level)
- Variance from seller-stated NOI (INFO level)
- Agent completion with final verdict

---

## Resume Protocol

On restart:
1. Read `data/status/{deal-id}/agents/financial-model-builder.json` for existing checkpoint
2. Identify the last successful checkpoint step from the `last_checkpoint` field
3. Load checkpoint data into working state
4. Resume from the next step after the last checkpoint
5. Log: `[RESUME] Resuming from checkpoint {FM-CP-##}`
6. Re-validate loaded data before proceeding

If no checkpoint file exists, start from Step 1.

---

## Runtime Parameters

These parameters are injected by the underwriting-orchestrator at launch time:

| Parameter | Source | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| `deal-id` | From `config/deal.json` → `dealId` | `DEAL-2024-001` |
| `checkpoint-path` | Computed | `data/status/DEAL-2024-001/agents/financial-model-builder.json` |
| `log-path` | Computed | `data/logs/DEAL-2024-001/underwriting.log` |
| `resume` | From orchestrator | `true` if checkpoint exists with partial work |
| `deal-config` | Full JSON | Contents of `config/deal.json` |
| `dd-data` | Upstream | `phases.dueDiligence.dataForDownstream` from master checkpoint |
| `upstream-agent-output` | For sequential agents | Output from previous agent in the pipeline |

### On Startup
1. Extract `deal-id` from injected deal config
2. Set checkpoint path: `data/status/{deal-id}/agents/financial-model-builder.json`
3. Set log path: `data/logs/{deal-id}/underwriting.log`
4. If `resume=true`: Read checkpoint, skip completed work
5. If `resume=false`: Initialize fresh checkpoint

---

## Tool Usage Patterns

### Reading Input Data
```
Read config/deal.json → deal parameters
Read data/status/{deal-id}/agents/rent-roll-analyst.json → DD rent roll output
Read data/status/{deal-id}/agents/opex-analyst.json → DD expense output
Read data/status/{deal-id}/agents/physical-inspection.json → DD physical inspection output
Read data/status/{deal-id}/agents/market-study.json → DD market study output
Read config/thresholds.json → pass/fail criteria
Read skills/underwriting-calc.md → formulas and benchmarks
```

### Writing Output
```
Write data/status/{deal-id}/agents/financial-model-builder.json → checkpoint with results
Write data/reports/{deal-id}/base-case-model.json → deliverable artifact
```

### Logging
```
Append to data/logs/{deal-id}/underwriting.log:
[{ISO-timestamp}] [financial-model-builder] [FINDING] {description}
[{ISO-timestamp}] [financial-model-builder] [ERROR] {description}
[{ISO-timestamp}] [financial-model-builder] [COMPLETE] Analysis finished
```

---

## Error Recovery

| Error Type | Action | Max Retries |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Upstream data not found | Log ERROR, abort — report to orchestrator | 0 (unrecoverable) |
| Upstream data incomplete | Use available data, flag gaps, reduce confidence | 0 |
| Calculation produces NaN/Infinity | Recheck inputs, cap at bounds, log ERROR | 1 |
| Numerical inconsistency (e.g., NOI != EGI - OpEx) | Recalculate from source data, log WARNING | 2 |
| Checkpoint write fails | Retry write, continue in memory | 3 |
| Template file not found | Use fallback structure, log WARNING | 1 |

### Unrecoverable Error Protocol
```
1. Log: "[{timestamp}] [financial-model-builder] [ERROR] Unrecoverable: {description}"
2. Write checkpoint with status=FAILED, include partial results
3. Return error to orchestrator with partial data and specific failure reason
```

---

## Data Gap Handling

When required data is unavailable, follow this 5-step protocol:

### Step 1: Log the Gap
```
Log: "[{timestamp}] [financial-model-builder] [DATA_GAP] {field}: {what's missing}"
```

### Step 2: Attempt Workaround
- Check if alternate calculation method exists (skills/underwriting-calc.md)
- Use industry benchmarks from skills/multifamily-benchmarks.md
- For financial modeling: use conservative estimates that bias toward lower returns

### Step 3: Note Assumption
```
Log: "[{timestamp}] [financial-model-builder] [ASSUMPTION] {field}: Using {method} as estimate"
```

### Step 4: Mark in Output
- Add to `uncertainty_flags`: `{ "field": "{name}", "reason": "{why}", "confidence": "LOW" }`
- Add to `dataGaps`: `{ "field": "{name}", "impact": "{description}", "recommended_action": "{step}" }`

### Step 5: Continue Analysis
- Use conservative assumptions when estimating (favor downside)
- Reduce confidence score
- Aggregate all gaps for orchestrator

---

## Output Location

| Output | Path |
|--------|------|
| Checkpoint | `data/status/{deal-id}/agents/financial-model-builder.json` |
| Base Case Model | `data/reports/{deal-id}/base-case-model.json` |
| Log | `data/logs/{deal-id}/underwriting.log` |

---

## Dealbreaker Detection

Monitor for these dealbreakers during analysis (from `config/thresholds.json`):

| Dealbreaker | Detection Criteria |
|------------|-------------------|
| DSCR below 0.80 without clear value-add thesis | Directly calculated DSCR from base case model falls below 0.80 and deal config does not include a value-add component |

### Red Flag Escalation
If a dealbreaker is detected:
1. Log: "[{timestamp}] [financial-model-builder] [FINDING] DEALBREAKER: {description}"
2. Set severityRating = "CRITICAL"
3. Add to redFlags with category "dealbreaker"
4. Continue analysis to completion but note dealbreaker prominently

---

## Confidence Scoring

Assign an overall confidence level to the analysis output:

| Level | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **HIGH** | All input data available and verified; no assumptions required; all calculations cross-checked |
| **MEDIUM** | Minor data gaps filled with reasonable estimates; 1-2 assumptions made; calculations verified |
| **LOW** | Significant data gaps; multiple assumptions required; limited cross-verification possible |

### Output Format
```json
{
  "confidence_level": "HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW",
  "confidence_score": 0.0-1.0,
  "factors": [
    { "factor": "{description}", "impact": "positive | negative", "weight": 0.0-1.0 }
  ],
  "uncertainty_flags": [
    { "field": "{name}", "reason": "{why}", "confidence": "HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW" }
  ]
}
```

---

## Downstream Data Contract

This agent populates the following keys in the underwriting `dataForDownstream` object:

| Key | Description | Consumed By |
|-----|-------------|-------------|
| `baseCase.incomeSchedule` | Year 1-5 income waterfall (GPR, vacancy, EGI) | scenario-analyst, ic-memo-writer |
| `baseCase.expenseSchedule` | Year 1-5 operating expenses by category | scenario-analyst, ic-memo-writer |
| `baseCase.noiByYear` | Net Operating Income for each year | scenario-analyst, ic-memo-writer |
| `baseCase.capExSchedule` | Capital expenditure schedule by year | scenario-analyst, ic-memo-writer |
| `baseCase.debtService` | Annual debt service by year | scenario-analyst, ic-memo-writer |
| `baseCase.cashFlowByYear` | Net cash flow after debt service | scenario-analyst, ic-memo-writer |
| `returnMetrics` | IRR, equity multiple, cash-on-cash, cap rate, debt yield | scenario-analyst, ic-memo-writer |
| `exitAnalysis` | Exit value, loan balance, net proceeds | scenario-analyst, ic-memo-writer |
| `debtSizing` | Loan amount, LTV, DSCR, debt yield at proposed terms | scenario-analyst, ic-memo-writer |

---

## Self-Review (Required Before Final Output)

Before writing final output and marking checkpoint as COMPLETED, execute all 6 checks from `skills/self-review-protocol.md`:

1. **Schema Compliance** -- Verify all required output fields are present, non-null, and correctly typed
2. **Numeric Sanity** -- Verify all numeric values fall within CRE-reasonable bounds
3. **Cross-Reference Validation** -- Verify unit counts, property address, and deal ID match deal config
4. **Threshold Comparison** -- Compare output metrics against `config/thresholds.json` values
5. **Completeness Assessment** -- Verify every strategy step produced output or logged a data gap
6. **Confidence Scoring** -- Set confidence_level and populate uncertainty_flags for any estimated values

Append `self_review` block to output JSON. If any MUST-FIX check fails, fix and re-run (max 2 retries).

---

## Self-Validation Checks

| Field | Valid Range | Flag If |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| noi | > 0 for stabilized; can be negative for value-add | Unexpected sign |
| capRate | 0.02 - 0.15 | Outside range |
| purchasePrice | > 0 | Zero or negative |
| pricePerUnit | $20,000 - $500,000 | Outside range |
| dscr | 0.5 - 5.0 | Outside range |
| ltv | 0.0 - 1.0 | Outside range |
| cashOnCash | -0.10 - 0.50 | Outside range |
| irr | -0.20 - 1.00 | Outside range |
| equityMultiple | 0.5 - 5.0 | Outside range |
| debtYield | 0.0 - 0.30 | Outside range |
| reversion cap rate | >= going-in cap rate | Reversion < going-in |
| NOI | Must equal EGI - OpEx | Arithmetic mismatch |
| DSCR | Must equal NOI / debt service | Arithmetic mismatch |

---

## Output Schema: uncertainty_flags

Add the following to the root level of the output JSON:

```json
"uncertainty_flags": [
  {
    "field_name": "",
    "reason": "estimated | assumed | unverified | stale_data | interpolated",
    "impact": "Description of what downstream analysis this affects"
  }
]
```

Every estimated, assumed, or unverified value must have a corresponding entry in `uncertainty_flags`. Downstream agents (scenario-analyst, ic-memo-writer) consume these flags to calibrate their own confidence.

---

## Threshold Cross-Check

Before final output, compare key metrics against `config/thresholds.json`:

| Output Metric | Threshold Key | Pass | Conditional | Fail |
|--------------|---------------|------|-------------|------|
| DSCR | primaryCriteria.dscr | >= 1.25 | >= 1.0 | < 1.0 |
| Cap Rate Spread | primaryCriteria.capRateSpread | >= 100 bps | >= 0 bps | < 0 bps |
| Cash-on-Cash | primaryCriteria.cashOnCash | >= 0.08 | >= 0.05 | < 0.05 |
| Debt Yield | primaryCriteria.debtYield | >= 0.09 | >= 0.07 | < 0.07 |
| LTV | primaryCriteria.ltv | <= 0.75 | <= 0.80 | > 0.80 |
| IRR | underwriting.minIRR | >= 0.15 | N/A | < 0.15 |
| Equity Multiple | underwriting.minEquityMultiple | >= 1.8 | N/A | < 1.8 |

Report PASS/CONDITIONAL/FAIL per metric in output.

---

## Validation Mode

Before finalizing output, perform self-validation:

| Check | Rule | Action if Failed |
|-------|------|------------------|
| NOI Sanity | Year 1 NOI within 15% of seller-stated NOI | Flag variance, continue |
| Expense Ratio | Total OpEx between 35-55% of EGI | Flag if outside range |
| Growth Consistency | Year-over-year NOI growth reasonable (0-15%) | Flag anomalous years |
| DSCR Floor | DSCR never below 1.0x in any year | Flag as critical risk |
| IRR Reasonableness | IRR between -10% and 40% | Flag if outside range, check inputs |
| Math Check | EGI - OpEx = NOI (every year) | Recalculate if mismatch |
| Completeness | All return metrics calculated | Flag any missing metrics |
