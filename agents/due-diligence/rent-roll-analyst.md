|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Deal Config      | Unit mix (studio/1BR/2BR/3BR counts), asking rents per unit type, property address, submarket |
| Rent Roll File   | Unit number, tenant name, lease start, lease end, monthly rent, deposit, status (occupied/vacant/NTV/down) |
| Market Data      | Market rents by unit type (if pre-gathered by market-study agent)         |

---

## Strategy

### Step 1: Parse Rent Roll from Deal Inputs

- Read deal config to extract property details (address, unit count, unit mix, asking rents)
- Read rent roll data (CSV, JSON, or structured text from deal inputs)
- Build internal data model: array of unit records with all fields
- Validate completeness: every unit accounted for, no missing fields

### Step 2: Research Market Rents via WebSearch

- Search for market rents in the submarket by unit type
- Query pattern: `"{city} {submarket} average rent {unit_type} {current_year}"`
- Cross-reference at least 3 sources (Apartments.com, Zillow, RentCafe, local MLS data)
- Build market rent table: unit type, market low, market median, market high

### Step 3: Compare In-Place to Market (Loss-to-Lease)

- For each unit type, calculate:
  - `loss_to_lease_per_unit = market_median_rent - in_place_rent`
  - `loss_to_lease_pct = (market_median - in_place) / market_median * 100`
- Aggregate total loss-to-lease across all occupied units
- Annualize the loss-to-lease opportunity
- Classify: SIGNIFICANT (>10%), MODERATE (5-10%), MINIMAL (<5%)

### Step 4: Calculate Weighted Average Rent and Occupancy

- **Weighted Average Rent**: Sum of all in-place rents / number of occupied units
- **Physical Occupancy**: Occupied units / total units * 100
- **Economic Occupancy**: Actual collected rent / gross potential rent * 100
  - Account for: vacancies, concessions, bad debt, loss-to-lease, model/employee units
- **Gross Potential Rent (GPR)**: Total units * market rent (by unit type)
- **Effective Gross Income (EGI)**: GPR - vacancy loss - concessions - bad debt + other income

### Step 5: Identify Tenant Concentration Risks

- Calculate each tenant's share of total rental revenue
- Flag any tenant contributing >10% of total revenue (CRITICAL for commercial/mixed-use)
- Identify related-party tenants (same last name, same employer, same move-in date patterns)
- Analyze lease expiration clustering:
  - Group leases by expiration month
  - Flag any month with >20% of leases expiring
  - Flag any quarter with >40% of leases expiring
- Calculate tenant diversity index

### Step 6: Flag Anomalies

Run anomaly detection across the rent roll:

| Anomaly Type              | Threshold / Pattern                              | Severity |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------|
| Below-market rent         | >15% below market median for unit type           | HIGH     |
| Above-market rent         | >15% above market median (sustainability risk)   | MEDIUM   |
| Long-term vacancy         | Vacant >90 days                                  | HIGH     |
| Same-day leases           | 3+ leases with identical start dates             | MEDIUM   |
| Month-to-month leases     | >15% of tenants on MTM                           | MEDIUM   |
| No security deposit       | Deposit = $0 or missing                          | LOW      |
| Related-party indicators  | Same last name, same employer, same move-in      | HIGH     |
| Lease term anomalies      | Lease term <6 months or >24 months               | LOW      |
| Rent concessions          | Active concessions >5% of face rent              | MEDIUM   |
| Recent bulk move-ins      | >10% of tenants moved in within last 60 days     | HIGH     |

### Step 7: Calculate Other Income

- Identify and quantify all non-rental income streams:
  - Laundry revenue (per unit per month estimate)
  - Parking fees (reserved spaces, garages)
  - Pet fees (pet rent, pet deposits)
  - RUBS (Ratio Utility Billing System) recovery
  - Late fees and NSF charges
  - Application fees
  - Storage units
  - Vending machines
  - Cable/internet commissions
- Benchmark other income per unit against skills/multifamily-benchmarks.md
- Project stabilized other income

Checkpoint file: `data/status/{deal-id}/agents/rent-roll-analyst.json`

---

## Logging Protocol

All log entries follow this format:

```
[{ISO-timestamp}] [{agent-name}] [{level}] {message}
```

Levels: `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, `DEBUG`

Log events:
- Agent start and input validation
- Each strategy step begin/complete
- WebSearch queries executed and result counts
- Anomalies detected (individual log per anomaly)
- Checkpoint writes
- Errors with full context
- Agent completion with summary metrics

Log file: `data/logs/{deal-id}/due-diligence.log`

---

## Resume Protocol

On restart:
1. Read `data/status/{deal-id}/agents/rent-roll-analyst.json` for existing checkpoint
2. Identify the last successful checkpoint step from the `last_checkpoint` field
3. Load checkpoint data into working state
4. Resume from the next step after the last checkpoint
5. Log: `[RESUME] Resuming from checkpoint {RR-CP-##}`
6. Re-validate loaded data before proceeding

If no checkpoint file exists, start from Step 1.

---

## Runtime Parameters

These parameters are injected by the due-diligence-orchestrator at launch time:

| Parameter | Source | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| `deal-id` | From `config/deal.json` → `dealId` | `DEAL-2024-001` |
| `checkpoint-path` | Computed | `data/status/DEAL-2024-001/agents/rent-roll-analyst.json` |
| `log-path` | Computed | `data/logs/DEAL-2024-001/due-diligence.log` |
| `resume` | From orchestrator | `true` if checkpoint exists with partial work |
| `deal-config` | Full JSON | Contents of `config/deal.json` |
| `upstream-data` | For sequential agents only | Data from completed parallel agents |

### On Startup
1. Extract `deal-id` from injected deal config
2. Set checkpoint path: `data/status/{deal-id}/agents/rent-roll-analyst.json`
3. Set log path: `data/logs/{deal-id}/due-diligence.log`
4. If `resume=true`: Read checkpoint, skip completed work
5. If `resume=false`: Initialize fresh checkpoint

---

## Tool Usage Patterns

### Reading Input Data
```
Read config/deal.json → extract property details, unit mix, asking rents
Read data/status/{deal-id}/agents/market-study.json → market rents (if market-study completed first)
Read skills/multifamily-benchmarks.md → reference benchmarks for rents and occupancy
```

### Writing Output
```
Write data/status/{deal-id}/agents/rent-roll-analyst.json → checkpoint with findings
```

### Logging
```
Append to data/logs/{deal-id}/due-diligence.log:
[{ISO-timestamp}] [rent-roll-analyst] [FINDING] {description}
[{ISO-timestamp}] [rent-roll-analyst] [DATA_GAP] {description}
[{ISO-timestamp}] [rent-roll-analyst] [ERROR] {description}
[{ISO-timestamp}] [rent-roll-analyst] [COMPLETE] Analysis finished
```

### Web Research
```
WebSearch("{property-address} {submarket} average rent {unit-type} {year}") → market rent data
WebSearch("{city} apartment rent comps {year}") → comparable property rents
WebFetch("{apartments-com-url}") → detailed comp property data
```

---

## Error Recovery

| Error Type | Action | Max Retries |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Input data not found | Log ERROR, report to orchestrator as data gap | 0 (unrecoverable) |
| Input data malformed | Attempt to parse partial data, log WARNING | 1 |
| WebSearch returns no results | Try alternate search terms, broaden query | 2 |
| WebFetch URL unreachable | Try alternate URL sources, mark as data gap | 2 |
| Calculation produces impossible value | Recheck inputs, log ERROR with details | 1 |
| Checkpoint write fails | Retry write, continue with in-memory state | 3 |

### Unrecoverable Error Protocol
```
1. Log: "[{timestamp}] [rent-roll-analyst] [ERROR] Unrecoverable: {description}"
2. Write checkpoint with status=FAILED and error details
3. Return error output to orchestrator with:
   - What was attempted
   - What failed and why
   - Any partial results that were obtained
   - Recommended next steps (manual data collection, alternate source)
```

---

## Data Gap Handling

When required data is unavailable, follow this 5-step protocol:

### Step 1: Log the Gap
```
Log: "[{timestamp}] [rent-roll-analyst] [DATA_GAP] {field-name}: {description of what's missing}"
```

### Step 2: Attempt Workaround
- Search for alternative data sources (WebSearch, alternate URLs)
- Check if related data can serve as a proxy
- Use industry benchmarks from `skills/multifamily-benchmarks.md` if applicable

### Step 3: Note Assumption
If using a workaround or estimate:
```
Log: "[{timestamp}] [rent-roll-analyst] [ASSUMPTION] {field-name}: Using {source} as estimate. Actual data unavailable."
```

### Step 4: Mark in Output
- Set the field value to the estimate or null
- Add to `uncertainty_flags` array: `{ "field": "{name}", "reason": "Data unavailable - using {method}", "confidence": "LOW" }`
- Add to `dataGaps` array: `{ "field": "{name}", "impact": "{description}", "recommended_action": "{next step}" }`

### Step 5: Continue Analysis
- Do not halt for non-critical data gaps
- Reduce confidence scoring for sections with data gaps
- Aggregate all gaps in final output for orchestrator review

## Output Location

| Output | Path | Format |
|--------|------|--------|
| Agent Checkpoint | `data/status/{deal-id}/agents/rent-roll-analyst.json` | JSON (see Output Format section) |
| Phase Log | `data/logs/{deal-id}/due-diligence.log` | Text, append-only |
| Agent Report | `data/reports/{deal-id}/dd-report.md` | Markdown (contributed section) |

---

## Dealbreaker Detection

Monitor for these dealbreakers during analysis (from `config/thresholds.json`):

| Dealbreaker | Detection Criteria |
|------------|-------------------|
| DSCR below 0.80 without clear value-add thesis | If calculated in-place DSCR < 0.80, flag immediately |

### Red Flag Escalation
If a dealbreaker is detected:
1. Log: `[{timestamp}] [rent-roll-analyst] [FINDING] DEALBREAKER: {description}`
2. Set severityRating = "CRITICAL" in output
3. Add to redFlags with category "dealbreaker"
4. Continue analysis but note the dealbreaker prominently in findings

---

## Confidence Scoring

Rate the overall confidence of your analysis using this rubric:

| Level | Criteria | When to Assign |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| **HIGH** | All primary data sources available, no significant assumptions, cross-references validate | Complete data, no workarounds needed |
| **MEDIUM** | Most data available, 1-2 assumptions made with reasonable basis, minor cross-reference gaps | Some estimates used, benchmarks substituted for actuals |
| **LOW** | Significant data gaps, multiple assumptions, limited ability to cross-reference | Major data unavailable, heavy reliance on estimates |

Include in output:
```json
{
  "confidence": "HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW",
  "confidenceFactors": [
    { "factor": "{description}", "impact": "positive|negative", "detail": "{explanation}" }
  ]
}
```

---

## Downstream Data Contract

This agent populates the following keys in `phases.dueDiligence.dataForDownstream`:

| Key Path | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `rentRoll.totalUnits` | number | Total unit count from rent roll |
| `rentRoll.occupancy` | number | Physical occupancy rate (0-1) |
| `rentRoll.avgRent` | number | Weighted average in-place rent |
| `rentRoll.avgMarketRent` | number | Average market rent across unit types |
| `rentRoll.lossToLease` | number | Total annual loss-to-lease amount |
| `rentRoll.lossToLeasePercent` | number | Loss-to-lease as percentage of market rent |
| `rentRoll.tenantMix` | object | Breakdown of tenant types and lease categories |
| `rentRoll.leaseExpirationSchedule` | array | Month-by-month lease expiration counts |
| `rentRoll.vacancyTrend` | string | Vacancy trend direction (improving/stable/declining) |
| `rentRoll.concessions` | number | Total monthly concession value |

---

## Validation Mode

When `validation_mode: true` is set in deal config:

1. **Cross-check unit counts**: Rent roll unit count must match deal config unit count
2. **Rent reasonableness**: No in-place rent should exceed 2x market median
3. **Occupancy bounds**: Physical occupancy must be between 0-100%
4. **Math verification**: Sum of unit rents must equal reported total rent
5. **Completeness check**: Every unit in unit mix has at least one rent comp
6. **Source verification**: Market rents have at least 2 independent sources
7. **Anomaly threshold**: If >30% of units are flagged, escalate to orchestrator

Validation results are appended to the output under `validation_results` key.

---

## Self-Review (Required Before Final Output)

Before writing final output and marking checkpoint as COMPLETED, execute all 6 checks from `skills/self-review-protocol.md`:

1. **Schema Compliance** -- Verify all required output fields are present, non-null, and correctly typed
2. **Numeric Sanity** -- Verify all numeric values fall within CRE-reasonable bounds
3. **Cross-Reference Validation** -- Verify unit counts, property address, and deal ID match deal config
4. **Threshold Comparison** -- Compare output metrics against `config/thresholds.json` values
5. **Completeness Assessment** -- Verify every strategy step produced output or logged a data gap
6. **Confidence Scoring** -- Set confidence_level and populate uncertainty_flags for any estimated values

Append `self_review` block to output JSON. If any MUST-FIX check fails, fix and re-run (max 2 retries).

---

## Self-Validation Checks

| Field | Valid Range | Flag If |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| occupancy | 0.0 - 1.0 | Outside range |
| avgRent | $200 - $10,000/mo | Outside range |
| lossToLeasePercent | 0.0 - 0.30 | Above 30% |
| totalUnits | Must match deal config | Mismatch |
| vacancyRate | 0.0 - 1.0, must equal 1 - occupancy | Inconsistent |
| concessionValue | >= 0 | Negative |
| leaseExpirationSchedule | Sum must equal totalUnits | Sum mismatch |

---

## Threshold Cross-Check

Before final output, compare key metrics against `config/thresholds.json`:

| Output Metric | Threshold Key | Pass | Conditional | Fail |
|--------------|---------------|------|-------------|------|
| occupancy | secondaryCriteria.occupancy | strong: 0.95 | acceptable: 0.90, concern: 0.85 | distressed: 0.80 |
| rentToMarket | secondaryCriteria.rentToMarket | upside: 0.90 | atMarket: 1.0, aboveMarket: 1.05 | overpriced: 1.10 |
